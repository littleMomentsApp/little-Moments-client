# Little Moments - Frontend

## Description

Welcome to Little Moments, the ultimate gift planning website! We understand the importance of receiving gifts that truly matter to you. That's why we've created a platform where you can plan and curate your very own list of gifts, making it easier for your loved ones to choose exactly what you need and desire.

At Little Moments, we believe that every gift should be special and meaningful. With our user-friendly interface, you have the freedom to create a personalized gift list tailored to your preferences. Whether it's for a birthday, wedding, baby shower, or any other special occasion, our platform empowers you to handpick the gifts that will make your moments unforgettable.

The frontend is built using React and interacts with the backend API, which can be found in our [backend repository](https://github.com/littleMomentsApp/little-Moments-server)
